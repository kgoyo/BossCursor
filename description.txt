Boss cursor adds arrows around your character that points towards the boss.

This way you do not need the mini-map open to be able to properly aim.

The size and transparency of the arrow changes the closer the boss is, so that you get a good feel for how far away the boss is, even when it is off screen.

Using the overlay map hides the cursor.

Boss cursor has ModConfig support that enables you to modify the cursors properties.
